# Grasshopper Repo

## Some code for Grasshopper and Rhino.Inside.Revit
Some of the code is for training and educaional purposes, some has been creted for live projets

- [x] Attractor Curve - Abstract\
  Training script to demonstrate the attractor logic -  how to influence the geometry or the position of a set of objects based on their distance to another object.

- [x] Attractor Curve - City\
  Training script to demonstarte practical use of attractor's logic in urban environment.

- [x] Attractor Curve - Panel\
  Training script to demonstarte practical use of attractor's logic to create parametric openings on a surface.

- [x] Generative Design - Views\
  Training script to demonstrate potential use of generative design.

- [x] Bake - By Category\
  Projects script for better export of geometry.

- [x] Generative Design - Evolutionary Optimization\
  Script that generates a number of buildings with DNA similar to the Sears Tower. Uses Galapagos ans evolutionary optization to maximize floor area and evaluates overshadowing of nearby neighbours.

- [x] Generative Design - Optioneering\
  Script that generates a number of buildings with DNA similar to the Sears Tower. Uses optioneering interface to optimize floor area and evaluates overshadowing of nearby neighbours.
